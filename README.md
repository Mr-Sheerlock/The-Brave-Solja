Dash and Shoot your way through enemies. Choose your weapons, upgrade your abilities.  Fight Bosses. Do the grind. Find Easter eggs and enjoy!

A Brave Solja is a game made in Unity Game Engine with the aspect of rewarding exploration in mind. I also tried to deliver challenging, fun-to-play bosses in various parts of the game. This was done utilizing a basic implemntation of FSM and event driven programming.
